I'm a graduate student at [UW PLSE](http://uwplse.org/). I want to create means
to express and
realize [thoughts](http://www.tractatuslogico-philosophicus.com/).

In my lab, that means to experiment with languages used to program machines. I
believe programs can be weaved from threads
([Autobahn](https://doi.org/10.1145/2976002.2976009)), in addition to being sewn
from fragments ([Metalift](http://metalift.uwplse.org)). Moreover, the act of
programming itself can be automated
([synthesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/2500000010)), if we can say what we want
clearly ([formal methods](https://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage)).
