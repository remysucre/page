=========

I'm a PhD student at [UW PLSE](http://uwplse.org/). I create means to
realize [thoughts](http://dissonance.remywang.me).

In my lab, that means to experiment with languages used to program machines. I
believe programs can be weaved from threads
([Autobahn](https://doi.org/10.1145/2976002.2976009)), in addition to being sewn
from fragments. Moreover, the act of programming itself can be automated
([synthesis](http://metalift.uwplse.org)), if we can say what we want clearly
([formal](http://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/remy-final-paper.pdf) [methods](DPEC.pdf)).
