=========

I'm a PhD student at [UW PLSE](http://uwplse.org/). I create means to
realize [thoughts](http://dissonance.remywang.me).

In my lab, that means to experiment with languages used to program machines. I
believe programs can be woven
from [threads](https://doi.org/10.1145/2976002.2976009), in addition to being
sewn from fragments. Moreover, the act of programming itself can
be [automated](http://metalift.uwplse.org), if we can
say
[what we want](http://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/remy-final-paper.pdf) [clearly](DPEC.pdf).
