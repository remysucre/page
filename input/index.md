I'm a PhD student at [UW PLSE][1] advised by [Alvin Cheung][11]. I create means to realize [thoughts][2].

In my lab, that means to [experiment][3] with languages used to program
machines. I believe programs can be woven from [threads][4], in addition to
being sewn from [fragments][10]. Moreover, the act of programming itself can be
[automated][5], if we can say [what we want][6] [clearly][7].

You can reach me via [email][8], or find me in 
the plse lab ([cse][9] 407).
